## ✨ Fun Facts from a Vibe Coder
- 🚦 Debugging is just **vibe-checking your code**  
- 🎶 Every project needs a playlist — my commits are powered by lo-fi & caffeine  
- 🐛 Bugs don’t scare me… unless they appear after deployment  
- 🕶️ I don’t always write code, but when I do, it’s probably at 3AM  
- 🤔 *“Does it work?”* → yes. *“Is it optimized?”* → let’s not ruin the vibe.
